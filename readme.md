# Sieve

This is a program to perform the [Sieve of Eratosthenes][soe].

## Details

- It's written in C++
- It's working on a `std::map`
- It's working bitwise on a `long long`
- It's possible to save the current sieve data.
- It's possible to load the saved sieve data.

## Done
- Check code for fails using CPP Check.
- Add feature to ~~abort process~~ and save current state.
- Add feature to resume aborted process.
- Enable UI for load/save current prime states.

## Todo
- Improve UI for
  - Enable user to set upper limit for determining prime numbers.
  - Enable user to start/stop prime sieving.
